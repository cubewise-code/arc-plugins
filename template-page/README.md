## Add this plugin to your application
1. Download the **template** folder
2. Paste the folder insite your plugins folder (Arc\plugins)
3. After clearing the cache you should now see the new **template** plugin under **Tools**

## To create a new plugin
1. Duplicate the **template-page** folder and rename it, we are going to call **my-new-plugin**

2. Rename plugin ID **arcTemplate** to a new id for example **myNewPlugin**, it appears 3 times.

At the bottom, it is used to close the tab:

It is safer to replace all:

<img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/downloads.cubewise.com/web_assets/arc-pulgins/create-a-new-plugin4.png" />

3. Replace the folder name with the new name **my-new-plugin**

4. Finally you just need to change the plugin name and icon which appear in the menu and the tab

5. Clear the cache and by clicking on your new plugin you should see the new tab:
